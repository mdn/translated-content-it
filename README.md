# Contributing to the Italian content of MDN Web Docs

:tada: First of all, thank you for taking the time to contribute to [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org)! :tada:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the [Italian content of MDN Web Docs](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content-it), which is hosted within the [MDN Organization](https://github.com/mdn) on GitHub.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Please understand that **the Italian content is fully _machine_-translated from the English content**.
>
> This means that _manual_ updates will be overwritten by a newer machine-translation as soon as the corresponding English content changes.
>
> The translation process is fully automated: For every changed page, we pre-process the English content, pass it along with [this system prompt][prompt] to an [OpenAI model](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models), and post-process the resulting Italian content before committing and pushing it to this repository.

## Contributing

You can contribute to the Italian content in the following ways:

1. **Report issues** you see.
2. **Review issues** reported by other users.
3. **Contribute** to the [translation **glossary**][glossary].
4. **Review** the the [translation **prompt**][prompt].

### 1. Reporting issues

If you see any issues with the Italian content, please report them:

- Create a GitHub issue using the "_Report a problem with this content_" links at the bottom of any Italian MDN page.
- Mention the issue [on Discord][discord] in the `#italian` channel.

Please prioritize reporting the following types of issues:

- Systematic and recurring errors affecting multiple MDN pages.
- Major errors that significantly hinder accuracy or comprehension.

### 2. Reviewing issues

If you see any [open issues here](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content-it/issues), please review them:

- Add emoji reactions to signal that you agree (üëç), disagree (üëé), or that you're looking into it (üëÄ).
- Add comments to provide additional context, examples, or solutions.
- Bring up the issue [on Discord][discord] in the `#italian` channel.

### 3. Contributing to the glossary

You can contribute to the [Italian translation glossary][glossary]:

- Suggest a new glossary entry by commenting in the file.
- Review the translations in the glossary, and provide feedback.
- Create a [new "Glossary" issue](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content-it/issues/new?template=bug.yml&title=Glossary+-+<SUMMARIZE+THE+PROBLEM>).

> [!NOTE]
> The translation glossary is a **work in progress**.
>
> It will be used to improve translations by passing matching glossary entries along with the system prompt.

### 4. Reviewing the prompt

If you have experience with prompt engineering, please review [the system prompt][prompt], and provide feedback:

- Start a discussion [on Discord][discord] in the `#italian` channel.
- Create a [new "Prompt feedback" issue](https://github.com/mdn/translated-content-it/issues/new?template=bug.yml&title=Prompt+feedback+-+<SUMMARIZE+THE+PROBLEM>).
